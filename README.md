Desgen is an open-source project dedicated to developing innovative designs through the latest UX/UI technologies to sketch your ideas onto the latest devices and platforms.
Most of the open-source organization and platforms have Web Development, Android Development, ML, etc, but ever wonder any organization or project which is completely dedicated to solving real-world problems related to UI? Think about designing a wireless garden management system, or a smart video management system!!
In Desgen we have a mission to bring meaningful changes in people's lives, we thrive every day to enable simpler solutions to the most complicated challenges. <br>
# We Believe:-
* Everyone is creative.
* Innovation starts with people.
* Technology moves fast, human needs change slowly.
* Creative organizations are more agile.
.<br>
# Our Approach
* We find out which designs work best by studying real users around the world as they interact with actual websites and applications.
* We believe it is more important to rely on what users actually do, rather than what they say they do.<br>
