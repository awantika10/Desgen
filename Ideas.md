### Description

Tourists helper App:
Places of natural beauty such as beaches, tropical island resorts, national parks, mountains, deserts and forests, are examples of traditional tourist attractions which people may visit.The main idea behind this app is that many a times tourist when they visit other countries to view beautiful places and to know more about a particular country.So not knowing the history about that place is quite natural.Thus ,guides are present to provide information about that palce.But this guides tend to charge more to the tourist.This is actually a real big problem for the tourist.So tourist helper is basically design to help them to provide more information about that particular place.This information would be available in any language as tourist wish.It will provide every information such as historical significance,nature,built beauty,living standards of the people and cultural value.And best part all this information would be free.
