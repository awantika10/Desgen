# How to start
Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.  

## Step 0 : Find an issue  üîç
- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!  
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.  
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

## Step 1 : Fork the Project üç¥ and clone it
- Fork this Repository. This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.  

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53532851/110444025-94106a00-80e2-11eb-8d7b-fd5f7a86f319.png)

 
- After this go to your terminal and clone this project on your desktop( git should be installed before - [link](https://git-scm.com/) )
  
```  
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Desgen 
$ cd <repo-name>  
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/awantika10/Desgen 
```  
- Update your forked repo before working.  
```  
$ git remote update  
$ git checkout <branch-name>  
$ git rebase upstream/<branch-name>  
```  
## Step 2 : Branch  üîñ
Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue you are addressing.  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53532851/110443654-282e0180-80e2-11eb-839f-3b89bd22b7fa.png)

```  
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to that branch 
$ git checkout -b branch_name  
```  

## Step 3 : Work on the issue assigned  üìï
- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.   
- Add all the files/folders needed.  
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by using terminal:  
```  
# To add all new files to branch Branch_Name  
$ git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
$ git add <some files>
```
- Using GitHub:

## Step 4 : Commit  
- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by using terminal:  
```
# This message get associated with all files you have changed  
$ git commit -m "message"  
```
- Using GitHub

![commit](https://github.com/LeeRenJie/Community-Website/blob/main/assets/cont-img/commit.png)  

### Commit message guidelines
- Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```
Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools

### Example commit message
```
feat(Profile): display QR code

fetch the QR code from API and display it on the Profile page (ProfileFragment.kt)

fixes #1234
```
A good rule of thumb for the commit message is to have a present tense verb, followed by whatever it is you're doing in as much detail as possible in 50 chars. Capitalize words correctly and follow general English.

## Step 5 : Work Remotely  
- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.  
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:  
  
```  
# To push your work to your remote repository  
$ git push -u origin <branch_name>  
```  
- Here is how your branch will look.

## Step 6 : Pull Request  üé£
- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
